# Parkzap-Image-Classification-Assignment


How I gathered my data to train my model?

I have done webscraping from google images i.e Maruthi Suzuki Swift and Jeep.

I have resized my images with python code because there will be different sizes of images in google.

Here I am attaching my Web Scraping Code and My resize code for your reference.
